From Boris to a Cherished Friend:
~ The person who I always had trouble understanding but the most understanding person of them all. ~

Hey there. Hi again. Can we meet again for the first time?
Yeah. I think this time it will be cooler. I'll be cheesier than ever 🧀, try to make you laugh more but still fail sometimes, or most of the time, or whatever...
It will almost be like the last time but not like the last time. Note: You can pretend my last sentence makes sense just for the sake of sophistication 🥸

Let me start by providing a little dictionary or an intro or a little knowledge base:

## A "beginning" backwards is "gninnigeb"

I just needed a new title so my paragraph became prettier. Anyway, New me. New you. Old clothes and some old bad habits. Phew!

## A mirror on the wall

I missed you much and I was reminiscing on my mistakes for a long time. Mirrors do exist to make us prettier and less dirty.

## A rubber duck

This is me. I am a rubber duck. I am made out of rubber and that means my head is also made out of rubber.

## Rubber ducks don't "quack". Or do they?

In my humble life experience of being a rubber duck I do "quack" and I do it quite a lot. 😆

### A quacking rubber duck quacks

Quack! Quack! Quack! - said the duck and quacked again. Amazing sound! Isn't it?

### A rubber duck with attitude

I am the kindest rubber duck of them all, said the rubber duck and quacked excitedly! Quack!

### The true demise of rubber ducks

Quacking can be quite exhausting, you know. You can only quack a limited number of times nicely with one fresh breath of air.
But you can still try to quack nicely when you are empty? Right?
Of course you can! You can try to quack! You can even give the best quickity-quack out of your rubber so you can help the other empty rubber ducks to take a breath of air.

## A short story for two half-empty rubber ducks

"You know what?" - said Duckitty
"What?" - said Duckelton
"When I quack too much I can't quack no more and I want to quack and that makes me sad." - answered Duckitty
Duckleton took a very serious look, furrowed his eyebrows and said in a wise voice:
"Yeah. I feel the same!"

## The rubber duck who hated being silent

Duckleton hated being silent and was giving a loud quack whenever he could. Sometimes he was quite empty and wondered if he was yellow enough to quack.
But you see, the factory that made Ducleton and Duckitty made them both perfectly yellow.
Duckleton was a rubber duck with attitude. He thought he could and he must out-quack every other duck to save them from the shame of not quacking when empty.
Duckitty had similar thoughts sometimes, or at least Duckleton was thinking this way when he was in his right mind. (Sometimes he was not 😆)
But Duckleton was a proud rubber duck. A rubber duck made in the best factory in the World that was making the best quacking yellow rubber ducks for centuries. At least Duckleton was thinking this way until he met Duckitty.
Once he met her he was so amazed by her voice that he thought she must have been made in some alien factory, much better than the Earth factory he was coming from.
He was happy to have the chance to just admire this wonderful and perfect rubber duck that was much better than him (he thought) named Duckitty.
"Well, it's so nice looking at her. She is so yellow. She is so nice. She has a much prettier voice than me. I am a lucky rubber duck." - Duckleton was thinking.

## A short but a bit sad story

Duckleton and Duckitty were both happy and quacking like it was the best quacking competition in the World and outer-space.
Once a human kid came and squeezed Duckleton. He was unable to quack for some time but he was still eager to do so, so he remained silent without complaining, took a deep breath and they both continued quacking happily.
Some time passed and Duckitty was also taken by a nasty human kid. The human kid squeezed all the air out of Duckitty but Duckleton was too busy quacking to notice.
Duckitty was okay but she had to take some air.
Duckleton was sad beyond despair. He thought that his favorite duck was broken and he was again forever alone till the end of the Universe. He just forgot that he had the same kid squeezing him some time ago.
Duckleton was proud but dumb, he had a little rubber head after all. Once Duckitty quacked, Duckleton was furious. He was both happy she was alive but he was a bit disheartened because he thought Duckitty could survive a human kid squeeze better than him.
She was so much more perfect than him after all, right?

## The guilt trip of Duckleton

Duckleton was the worst hypocrite of them all and he finally learned it. He was sad but he thought: Let's apologize to Duckitty and show her some gratitude for being so perfect as she is.

## Epilogue

My dear friend, you were perfect for the last 8 years. You were perfect every single day. I am quite sorry for being such a hypocrite but bad stuff happens you know. And we still go on.
Please, love yourself much more. I am dumb. You are smart. Or whatever... But love yourself much more, because you are perfect as you are!
In fact you are the most perfect yellow rubber duck in the World. At least I think like that. My rubber head is small. But, Yay! I can still think. 🫶
Quack!

Quack, Quack, Quack
~ Duckleton
